A binary tree is a type of data structure used in computer science to store and organize data in a hierarchical manner. It consists of nodes, where each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

The topmost node of a binary tree is called the root node, and each node may have a value associated with it. The left child of a node is smaller than the parent node, while the right child is larger. This property makes binary trees particularly useful for searching and sorting algorithms.

Binary trees come in different shapes and sizes, but they all follow the same basic structure. For example, a complete binary tree has every level filled except possibly the last, where all nodes are as far left as possible. On the other hand, a balanced binary tree is one where the left and right subtrees of any node differ in height by no more than one.

Binary trees can be traversed in different ways, such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order. These traversal methods allow you to visit each node in a specific order and perform certain operations on them.
